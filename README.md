My name is Maurice di Tolve, i'm a junior Front End Developer from Groningen, The Netherlands.

In this project I will be sharing/applying/learning the newest developments in the world of Front End.

I have used Laravel, and will continue to add to this project using PHP, SCSS, JS, Vue, Tailwind and more.


Below I will share the steps i've made to bring the project to where it is today, with the most recent steps/additions shown from the top.
________________________________________________________________________________________________//


- A bunch of tailwind-classes were added to the pictures on the vue-one page

- Pictures added to public/images/vue-one, will be called upon by vue

- New 'persons' added to vue-one page and dynamically called

- Introduced several mouse-events to different divs

- Overflows added to vue-one page, content was filling up the page and it was still on hidden previously

- Toggle button added which will show or hide the info on the vue-one page, depending on if the info is already showing, or if its hidden.

- Added additional info including name, age, city and profession

- Adding first conditionals in Vue, seems quite straightforward!

- Error found and fixed, both Blade and Vue use {{  }} syntax, so @ has to be added

- php error shown when trying to load the page, internet search has not done the trick so far

- Vue logo has been added to Vue Card

- Added new page for first Vue stuff, npm installing didn't quite work, trying other ways

- Re-added comments to the JS-two JS Logic

- Changed the styling on the JS-Two page to be more consistent

- Added border-radius variable in app.scss for consistency

- Added 'window.onload' to the JS logic of the To-do page, it now executes after the DOM is fully loaded. This fixed the issue that occured before

- First basics of Tailwind have been added, small styling issues on home-page how now been fixed

- Added new folder 'pages' for scalability, moved the blade files and changes the routes

- Absolute mess, slight damage control, hopefully nothing is lost in the process..

- Added JS logic for the timer (countdown), works with getElementByClassName, tried to chain the classes..but couldn't get it to work. Also tried with querySelecterAll and then chaining the same classes, after this failed, I copied the logic 3 times over with different classnames. (it works)

- Included all the stuff required for Tailwind

- 'npm install tailwindcss' Might as well try it

- Added JS-two, WIP, but dropping it for now for bigger project

- Wrapped last weeks JS in a check to see if user is on the right page for it to trigger

- Renamed a bunch of stuff for consistency

- Added JS script asset loader to the header partial (it works)

- Added correct routing to JS-One (the reload page)

- Changed some routes in web

- Added button with hover / focus-within transitions. Additional styling will be added later

- Buttons added to several pages

- Added a bit of styling to the 'home' page

- Added 'home' background image and gradient

- Added comments to .scss files

- Added 'partials' folder to project, 'header' and 'footer' partials have been made

- CSS href added to header

- Changed README.md file
