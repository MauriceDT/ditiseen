My name is Maurice di Tolve, i'm a junior Front End Developer from Groningen, The Netherlands.

In this project I will be sharing/applying/learning the newest developments in the world of Front End.

I have used Laravel, and will continue to add to this project using php,scss,js and more.


Below I will share the steps i've made to bring the project to where it is today, with the most recent steps/additions shown from the top.

- Added JS logic for the timer (countdown), works with getElementByClassName, tried to chain the classes..but couldn't get it to work. Also tried with querySelecterAll and then chaining the same classes, after this failed, I copied the logic 3 times over with different classnames. (it works)

- Absolute mess, slight damage control, hopefully nothing is lost in the process..

- Included all the stuff required for Tailwind

- 'npm install tailwindcss' Might as well try it

- Added JS-two, WIP, but dropping it for now for bigger project

- Wrapped last weeks JS in a check to see if user is on the right page for it to trigger

- Renamed a bunch of stuff for consistency

- Added JS script asset loader to the header partial (it works)
